# Dashboard

A basic Light and Dark Mode Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸ“– About This Project

This is a simple UI dashboard with Light and Dark mode toggle.
Itâ€™s not responsive yetâ€”just a simple static design for practice.

I built this while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Honestly, I got bored midway because I learned new concepts and wanted to move on to something fresh. So, I decided to wrap this up as a basic design. Thereâ€™s a lot I planned to add, but Iâ€™ll do it in future projects.
